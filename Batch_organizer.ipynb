    "#### Batch Organizer Tool for Sample Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Welcome to the Batch Organizer Tool, an utility designed to streamline the organization of your sample collection into randomized, stratified batches. This tool is ideal for researchers and scientists who need to manage large datasets with complex hierarchical structures, such as herbarium collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "    CSV File Input: Simply upload your .csv file containing the details of your sample collection. Ensure that your file includes columns for family, species, and genus.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Stratified Sampling: The tool focuses on the taxonomical family to ensure that each batch is representative of the diversity within your collection. This stratification minimizes bias and maintains the integrity of your samples.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Randomization: Within each family, samples are randomized to further reduce bias and ensure that each batch is varied.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    QC Sample Integration: Each batch includes 3 QC samples (Blank, CQ-1, CQ-2) distributed as follows: 3 QCs + 23 samples + 3 QCs + 23 samples + 3 QCs + 22 samples + 3 QCs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Batch Creation: Organize your samples into batches of 68, or a size of your choosing. The tool automatically calculates the number of batches required and distributes samples accordingly.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Output: Each batch is saved as a separate CSV file, ready for further analysis or processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* How It Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Upload Your Data: Start by uploading your CSV file. The file should contain columns named \"family\", \"species\", and \"genus\".\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Proportion Calculation: The tool calculates the proportion of each family within your dataset to ensure balanced representation in each batch.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Randomized Stratification: Samples are stratified by family and then randomized within each family to create balanced and varied batches.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    QC Sample Integration: Each batch is structured to include QC samples in the following order:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        3 QC samples (Blank, CQ-1, CQ-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "        23 randomized samples\n",
    "\n",
    "        3 QC samples (Blank, CQ-1, CQ-2)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        23 randomized samples\n",
    "        \n",
    "        3 QC samples (Blank, CQ-1, CQ-2)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        22 randomized samples\n",
    "        \n",
    "        3 QC samples (Blank, CQ-1, CQ-2)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Batch Creation: The tool divides your samples into the specified structure, ensuring each batch reflects the proportional diversity of your collection.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Output Files: Each batch is saved as a CSV file, ready for download and further use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Use Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a dataset of 1000 herbarium samples, representing various species across different genera and families. You need to organize these samples into batches for analysis, ensuring that each batch is representative of the overall diversity and includes QC samples in a specific order. This tool automates the process, saving you time and ensuring statistical robustness."

    "##### Explanation of the Script:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Load the Data:\n",
    "        Reads the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Check for Family Column:\n",
    "        Ensures the family column exists in the file.\n",

    "        Lists the QC samples (Blank, QC_Inter_Batch, QQ_Inter_Batch).\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Calculate Proportions:\n",
    "        Calculates the proportion of each family in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. Define Batch Structure:\n",
    "        Specifies the number of samples and QC samples in each batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "    6. Calculate Number of Batches:\n",
    "        Determines the number of batches needed based on the total samples and batch structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "    7. Create Batches:\n",
    "        Randomly selects samples for each family proportionally.\n",
    "        Ensures each batch contains the required number of samples and QC samples in the specified structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "    8. Save Batches:\n",
    "        Saves each batch as a separate CSV file."

    "##### How to Judge?\n",
    "\n",
    "To judge whether stratification was achieved, you should compare the distribution of families and genera in each batch to the overall distribution in the original dataset. The key points to look for include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Similarity in Distribution:\n",
    "     The bar plots for each batch should closely resemble the bar plots for the overall distribution.\n",
    "     The relative proportions of each family and genus in the batches should be similar to their proportions in the overall dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Consistency Across Batches:\n",
    "     Each batch should have a similar composition, reflecting the diversity of the original dataset.\n",
    "     There should not be any significant discrepancies or outliers in the distribution of families and genera across different batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Points to Look For:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Proportional Representation: The heights of the bars in the batch plots should be proportionally similar to the heights of the bars in the overall plot. For example, if the family \"Asteraceae\" makes up 20% of the original dataset, it should also make up approximately 20% of each batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Presence of All Groups: All families and genera present in the original dataset should also be present in the batches, assuming the batch size is large enough to capture the diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* No Over- or Under-Representation: No single family or genus should be significantly over- or under-represented in any batch compared to the overall dataset."
